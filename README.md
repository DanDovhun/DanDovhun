### Hello world, I'm Daniel

I'm a simple programmer trying to find his way in the universe. I'm working on my Bachelor degree in Software Engineering and Management at the University of Gothenburg.

When you see me and I'm not working on school work, I'm probably working on a personal project. I usually work with Go, but I tend to work with Vue, Java and occasionally Rust, but I have experience with C/C++ and Java.
